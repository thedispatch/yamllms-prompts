# List Factual Assertions

Briefly itemize all of the most salient factual assertions made in the following text. Be terse and concise: no yapping.

Note that projections and opinions, to the effect that something "would" or "could" happen, are not factual assertions. Nor are judgement calls, arguable categorizations, indications, suggestions, general conclusions about the overall state of a system or project, or similar subjective assessments. Do not include any of those: focus strictly on concrete, verifiable facts that are either true or false.
