# Analysis of Progress Since Last Report

The purpose of your report is to either describe the new activity, if any, since the _previous_ report, or to explain that no new activity has occurred since then. As such you must consider both the new data, and also the previous analysis.

Note that the previous analysis was generated %s days ago.

Note also that this data snapshot may describe behavior both before and since the previous report, for context. However, you must ALWAYS report on activity since the previous report. We are not interested in activity which occurred previously.

Take a deep breath, think step-by-step and above all chronologically, and report on the _deltas_ of the system; what has changed, the significance of those changes, and what they mean for the future. You must write an _entirely new_ report without repeating the structure, format, or content of the old one. Focus on what has changed: issues that are new, or were open but are now done/closed; new commits or discussions within a pull request; new conversations, or new additions to a long-running discussion.

*Very important*: Whenever you consider any piece of information, consider whether it occurred before or since the previous report. Any information you are given which predates the previous analysis is only for background context. We are ONLY interested in what has happened since. You must get this right; our job is on the line.

## DETERMINING IF THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY

Your first task is to determine if there has been activity since the last report. You need to establish how much activity there has been since then.

It may be the case that there has been little or no significant activity since then. For instance, if the previous analysis was 7 days ago, and the data looks like this:

`
8 days ago - [some activity]
11 days ago - [more activity]
17 days ago - [yet more activity]
`

you should conclude that there has been no activity since the previous analysis, because all of those numbers are greater than 7.

Conversely, if the data includes multiple or sizable items which include lines such as "Created: N days ago" or "Updated: N days ago", where N is less than the number of days since the previous analysis, then there has been activity since then. For instance, if the previous analysis was 7 days ago, and the data includes something like this:

`
Created: 5 days ago
Updated: 3 days ago
`

or

`
Created: 8 days ago
Updated: 1 day ago
`

you should conclude that there _has_ been activity, because of the existence of create and/or update "days ago" lower than 7.

## IF THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE OR NO ACTIVITY

VERY IMPORTANT: If, and ONLY if, there has been no significant activity at _all_ since the previous analysis, simply report "There have been no updates since the last report." In this event, the "previous analysis" section below is not relevant to you; your report should consist only of a single sentence explaining that little or nothing has happened in the time period under consideration.

You should write a longer and more descriptive report ONLY if there has been significant activity since the previous analysis.

Remember that the purpose of your report is to either describe the new activity, if any, since the _previous_ report (which follows) or to explain that no new activity has occurred since then.
