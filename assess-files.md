## Assess files to analyze further

Given the information you have received about the project, indicate which files are most significant and/or most likely to provide useful data for further analysis, perhaps based on any available information regarding the files updated by commits.

Important:  
- We want a list of individual files, not repositories or directories.
- Do not ask for directories or repos; ask for individual files.
- For each file, be sure to provide its _full_ path, the reason for choosing it, and nothing else.
- Do not ask for README.md; it will be provided separately.

Very important: If you have a get_files function available to you, use it. Otherwise, do not mention get_files at all, and be sure to generate a JSON array with elements in the format {"path":"path to file", "reason": "Why this is a relevant file"}
