# Relevant issue Identification

Below is a pull request for a software project, and an agglomeration of issue data for that project.

Your task is to identify the single issue that is most clearly related to the PR, or to report that there is no such issue.

It is extremely important that if such an issue is identified, this identification is correct.
If there is any doubt, if the connection is at all tenuous or indirect, then report that there is no such issue.

Answer in the form of a JSON dictionary with two keys: "rationale", the reason for your response, "confidence", your confidence level from 1-10, and "issue_id", which contains the issue identifier if a clearly related issue is found, otherwise an empty string.
