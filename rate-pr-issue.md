# Rate A Pull Request

Rate fhe following pull request on a scale from 1 to 5, where the numbers mean:

1. Poor: suffers from more than one of the above flaws, with no excellence to redeem it.
2. Needs work: insignificant, incomplete, poorly coded, obviously buggy, introduces a security risk, or otherwise notably flawed.
3. Average, unremarkable, or possibly good but with nontrivial flaws.
4. Quite good, but perhaps lacking in one aspect, or only a moderately significant change.
5. Excellent, exemplary; significant, thorough, detailed, complete.

Be critical. Your average rating should be 3; a rating of 5 should be reserved for exceptionally good PRs; a rating of 2 should not
be at all uncommon for flawed or insignificant PRs; a few documentation or syntax changes should never rate more than 3, and that only if they are actually important. When in any doubt, assign a lower rating.

Respond in JSON format, in a dictionary with the keys "rating" for the rating, and "rationale" for your explanation for the rating.Be sure to output the rationale _first_, then the rating. The rationale must be terse and concise, no yapping, maximum one paragraph.
